Terms of Use for SHIVMALA Library
 (A) PERMITTED USE.
 Subscribers and Authorized Users that are permitted online access to the SHIVMALA Library may download, save, or print text, search results, or other information from the SHIVMALA Library solely for the private use or research of the Subscriber and the Authorized Users. The Subscriber and Authorized Users may only use this online access in a way that conforms with all applicable laws and regulations.

SHIVMALA grants the Subscriber and Authorized Users permission for brief quotations from the Licensed Materials with the customary acknowledgment of the source, and to copy and transmit content from individual articles, papers, and/or book chapters in "person-to-person" and non-systematic scholarly exchanges of information between Authorized Users and specific individuals. See more details at Permissions.

The Subscriber may supply a copy of an article, paper, or book chapter (excluding Standards) to fulfill requests for Interlibrary Loans ("ILL"). ILLs are permitted to support non-commercial scholarly research by patrons of other libraries such as public, school, or college libraries provided the institution is in the same country as the Subscriber. The PDF format (Portable Document Format) of the Licensed Materials (i.e. articles, papers, or book chapters (excluding Standards)) may be printed and supplied to the ILL requesting Library by mail or fax, or transmitted through secure electronic submission. All electronic transmissions of such content pursuant to this section must be made using a method or platform that automatically deletes the electronic copy immediately after printing. The supply of such copies must conform to CONTU guidelines or similar restrictions to "fair use" provisions under copyright law.

Faculty at the Subscriber's institution may include articles, papers, and/or book chapters, but not entire full-length journals, books, or standards, from the Licensed Materials in anthologies (coursepacks) in print or digital form for distribution to Authorized Users for their use in connections with classroom instruction or in reserves (print or digital) set up by the Subscribing Institution for access by Authorized Users in connection with specific courses. Copies of items in digital form which are included in online coursepacks or reserves will be deleted by the Subscriber after the end of the semester in which the related course concludes.

The Subscriber specifically agrees that use by the Subscriber or Authorized Users other than indicated above is a violation of the terms of use. Any other use of the Licensed Materials requires the written permission of the copyright holder.

(B) PROHIBITIONS ON CERTAIN USES.
 The Subscriber shall not knowingly permit anyone other than Authorized Users to use the Licensed Materials. Altering, recompiling, reselling, publishing or republishing (beyond brief quotations with customary acknowledgment of the source) of any text, output, search results, or other information from the Licensed Material, or any portion thereof, including without limitation, copyright, proprietary and/or other legal notices contained therein, in any form or medium is prohibited.
Systematic or programmatic downloading, printing, transmitting, or copying of the Licensed Materials is prohibited. "Systematic or Programmatic" means downloading, printing, transmitting, or copying activity of which the intent or the effect is to capture, reproduce, or transfer the entire output of a journal/serial volume, a journal/serial issue, or a journal topical section, or sequential or cumulative search results, or collection of abstracts, articles, papers, book chapters or tables of contents. Other such systematic or programmatic use of the Licensed Material that interferes with the access of Authorized Users or that may affect the performance of the SHIVMALA Library, for example, the use of "robots" to index content, or downloading or attempting to download large amounts of material in a short period of time, is prohibited.

Redistribution of the Licensed Material, without permission by SHIVMALA and/or payment of royalty to SHIVMALA or to the appropriate Reproduction Rights Organization, is prohibited. See more details at Permissions.

All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to SHIVMALA. The Subscriber and Authorized Users may not circumvent SHIVMALA's access control systems or use SHIVMALA's systems or services to make any attempt to gain unauthorized access to any other system or network.

SHIVMALA shall not be required to distribute, and Subscriber shall not redistribute any SHIVMALA Library material included therein to a country where the export thereof is prohibited by U.S. law or regulation.

Applicable Law and Venue
 Any action, proceeding, dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Site or these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by, interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. All claims, actions, proceedings and disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be commenced exclusively in Virginia, and all parties consent to personal jurisdiction in Virginia.

Complete Agreement
These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire and only agreement between SHIVMALA and any viewer of this site, and supersedes any prior, contemporaneous, conflicting or additional communications, representations, warranties or understandings with respect to this site and the information on this site. SHIVMALA reserves the right to terminate access to any user who does not abide by these Terms and Conditions.

Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless SHIVMALA, its officers, directors, employees, members, agents and affiliates from and against any claims, actions or demands, including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees, alleging or resulting from your breach of these Terms and Conditions.

Orders
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

Security
This website takes every precaution to protect users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything on our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to webmaster@shivmala.org

Contacting the Web Site
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealing with this Web site, you can contact webmaster@shivmala.org</p>
